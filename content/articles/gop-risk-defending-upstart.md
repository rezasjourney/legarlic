WASHINGTONâ€”Due to an alarming lack of competent, experienced leadership, multiple members of the GOP said Wednesday that the Republican Party stands a strong chance of losing all fights over conservative positions if it does not find effective spokespeople to swiftly articulate those positions to the public. "Though the establishment might be the only response to the criticism directed at our party, the fact remains that the GOP will be completely unable to stand up for itself on the issue of immigration, unless they find some 21st-century Jim DeMint to give the party's p.r. response," said GOP media consultant Danny Lopez, adding that Trump's brand of uncompromising bigotry "will be a threat to our party's future, especially if other strong-minded leaders aren't able to pull this off." At press time, Lopez added that, on the whole, he'd still recommend the Republicans do what they can to get to the bottom of Benghazi and Fast and Furious, too.
